# The OS-FreeBSD module does "all the things" in a FreeBSD installation.
# Since the other modules -- users, fstab, grub, pretty much all of them
# -- are Linux-specific, it doesn't make much sense to fork each of them
# or provide alternatives, so instead we have one module that completes
# a FreeBSD installation based on the GlobalStorage values set by
# Calamares viewmodules.
